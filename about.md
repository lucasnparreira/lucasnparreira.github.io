### 🚀 My Mission
**"I build bridges between data-driven insights and production-ready software. I build systems that learn, scale, and provide measurable value."**

---

### 💻 Software Engineering
In my software journey, I focus on **reliability and scalability**. I believe that code is a tool for communication—both with the machine and with other developers. 
* **Core Philosophy:** Clean Code, SOLID principles, and automated testing.
* **Specialties:** Microservices, API Design, and Cloud Infrastructure.

### 📊 Data
My approach to data is rooted in **curiosity and rigor**. I don't just look for patterns; I look for actionable truths that can drive product decisions.
* **Core Philosophy:** Data is useless without context. I focus on the "Story" behind the numbers.
* **Specialties:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Modeling, and Data Visualization.
