### 🔍 Project Overview
The **Sistema de Ponto** is a software engineering solution focused on the accurate recording and management of employee time logs. It addresses the complexity of calculating work hours, breaks, and overtime while ensuring data integrity.

### 🏗️ Engineering Highlights
* **Domain Logic:** Implemented complex business rules for time calculation and validation.
* **Architecture:** Followed clean coding principles to separate the user interface from the core processing logic.
* **Data Persistence:** Designed to store logs securely, preventing unauthorized modifications to historical time data.

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities
1. **Clock-in/Out Management:** Real-time logging of work events.
2. **Shift Calculation:** Automated math to determine total hours worked per day/month.
3. **Reporting:** Generating summaries for human resources or management review.
